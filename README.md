The datased used is SIDD (Smartphone Image Denoising Datset). There are multiple versions, I used the smallest one, since I am not training a model, just testing traditional methods. The dataset is located in the data\ folder, unzipped from the original download (the images are in data\SIDD_Small_sRGB_Only\Data)
